                <summary>Who am I</summary>
                <p>My name is Ali Alavi. I live and study in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
            </details>

            <details open>
                <summary>What I like</summary>
                <p>To hack around. I love to code, and to build cool stuff. Sometimes I like to build stuff from bare metal, and recently I've been throwing some ML in the mix.
I like small, simple things that work well. Like a minimalistic web page, a small but well-documented library, or a simple yet brilliant algorithm:</p>
                	<pre>
  while (a != b):
    if a > b:
      a = a - b
    elif b > a:
      b = b - a
                	</pre>
<p>+ good wine, good food, good company.</p>

            </details>

                <summary>What I've done</summary>
                <p>I've worked with some startups in Scandinavia, Canada and the Middle East, in the fields of <a href="https://www.intelldx.com/">embedded systems</a>, <a href="http://lipit.eu/">wearables</a> and web applications. I've also done some <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Fz3BFGEAAAAJ&hl=en">research</a>, but I consider myself more of an engineer+hacker than an academic. </p>
            </details>

            <details open>
                <summary>What's next</summary>
                <p>I would be writing on my thesis, and working on a startup idea I had for some time. At the same time, I'd love to get to know people with a passion in wearables, IoT, and tech in general. I'm also interested in part time opportunites as a software developer, embedded engineer, or lecturer.</p>
            </details>
